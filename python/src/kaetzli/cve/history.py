"""Known vulnerabilities over time, and what the package updates did to them:

    ./test/cve-history.py              # this architecture, the last 15 green builds on main
    ./test/cve-history.py arm64        # name one
    RUNS=40 ./test/cve-history.py      # look further back

Two series, because the count moves for two reasons:

  same database   every build's SBOMs (the sbom-<arch> artifact) rescanned now, with one
                  vulnerability database (test/cve-scan.py, with ENRICH for SBOMs from
                  before env.sh had CPE=). Advisories published since are counted against
                  old and new builds alike, so this moves only when the image changed: a
                  bump that closes some is a step down.
  at build time   what the cve-scan job found on the day (the cve-<arch> artifact): the
                  exposure of the image as published, newly disclosed advisories included.
                  Only as far back as that job has run.

Each step is put down to the commits between the two builds: "update" when all of them
are the updater's ("Update <pkg> to <version>"), "other" when none is, "mixed" when both.
The totals at the end are the same-database steps summed by that label, which is the
answer to "how much do the updates help".

Builds from before the extensions had SBOMs are the disk image alone; the series says so
when it changes shape. History reaches as far back as artifact retention. Like
test/size-history.py this reports and never fails.
