"""Known vulnerabilities in what a build ships, from its SBOMs, as a report.

    ./test/cve-scan.py [dir]         # every sbom-*.json in dir (default output/)
    ENRICH=1 ./test/cve-scan.py dir  # first add today's CPEs to SBOMs that have none

grype matches the SBOMs image/build-rootfs.sh and image/build-extension.sh write: C
packages by the CPE in their env.sh, Go modules and Rust crates by purl. It writes

  <dir>/cve/<sbom>.json     grype's matches, for whoever wants the detail
  <dir>/cve-summary.txt     one line per SBOM and one for the whole build, the series
                            test/cve-history.py plots

and a text job summary. It never fails a build: the count of open CVEs is something to
watch, not to gate on, and a missing scanner or an unreachable database ends in a note.

The count moves for two reasons, and only one of them is ours: a version bump closes
advisories, and the world opens new ones against what has not changed. The database's
build date is recorded with each scan so the two can be told apart; test/cve-history.py
rescans old builds with one database to take the second away.

ENRICH is for SBOMs from before env.sh had CPE= (test/cve-history.py): each package gets
the CPE its env.sh has today, with the SBOM's version in it.

Patched is not open. A package whose packages/<pkg>/patches fix a CVE says so in its SBOM
entry, as an SPDX `fix` reference (tools/patch-cves.sh, image/sbom.sh); each SBOM's
references become an OpenVEX document (<dir>/cve/<sbom>.vex.json) that grype applies, so
those matches move from `matches` to `ignoredMatches` with a vex rule. Every count here is
what is open; the patched ones are counted beside it and listed by name.
