"""How far the builder's development headers are from the libraries we ship:

    ./tools/header-skew.py

Every library in packages/ is compiled against twice over, in a sense: packages that link
it compile against *Debian's* header for it (the -dev section of builder/deps.txt, since
the CI sysroot is glibc alone), and run against *ours*, found by SONAME. That works while
the two stay close, and docs/guides/linking.md is the long version of why.

This is the report that says how close. For each -dev package in that section: sid's
version, ours, and which is newer. Ours newer is the safe direction — a library is
backwards compatible with headers older than itself. sid's newer is the one to look at: a
binary built against that header may call a function our library does not have yet.
Whether one actually does is test/check-symbol-resolution.py's question (and, for a
library with versioned symbols, test/check-symbol-versions.py's); this only says where to
expect it. It never fails: a skew is a fact about two release schedules, not a bug.
