# The CVEs a package's patches fix, one per line:
#
#     ./tools/patch-cves.sh glibc
#     CVE-2026-8674	upstream/0019-resolv-Fix-assertion-failure-on-search-list-trunc.patch	git+https://sourceware.org/git/glibc.git@1f502624…
#
# Tab-separated: the CVE, the patch under packages/<pkg>/patches/, and where the fix comes
# from (the upstream commit, the upstream patch file, or the patch in this repository).
# build.sh records these in the package's component record, image/sbom.py turns them into
# SPDX `fix` references, and test/cve-scan.py into an OpenVEX document grype applies, so
# a CVE a patch closes is reported as patched rather than open (docs/guides/patches.md).
#
# Two sources, because neither is complete:
#
#   - the patch's message: a CVE named anywhere before the diff starts. That is the commit
#     message of a `git format-patch` file (glibc's backports say "CVE-2026-8674" in the
#     subject or body), the report heading a bash53-NNN, or a line in our own patch. The
#     diff itself is never read: glibc's first backport adds a file listing every advisory
#     ever published, and none of those is fixed by it.
#   - patches/upstream.cves, which tools/sync-patches.sh writes from an upstream's advisory
#     database where there is one (glibc's advisories/, by Fix-Commit on our branch): it
#     knows fixes whose commit message does not name the CVE.
#
# Our own patch says what it fixes in its message, e.g. a `CVE: CVE-2026-12345` line
# above the diff. A message that names a CVE it does not fix ("the fix for CVE-x did not
# cover…") would be counted, so read what this prints when a new patch lands.
